This application for android devices searches for pictures (JPEG) on your device and <b>adds a thumbnail</b> if they don't have one yet. Thumbnails are added to the EXIF metadata structure.

It is designed to work from android Oreo (android 8, SDK 26) and was tested on real device running Android 10 and virtual device running android 8 and 11.

For more information, some know facts and how you may contribute, refer to the [project homepage][1].

<b>Rationale</b>

On my phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S), when wanting to import my pictures to Windows (or any device/operating system supporting MTP or PTP protocols), I noticed the pictures don't display a thumbnail in the import wizard (whether through the Photos app, or through the Windows Explorer import feature). This is because my phone didn't add the thumbnail to the pictures I took with the camera.

<b>Features</b>

- Add thumbnail to pictures (JPEG) that don't yet have one
- Lanczos algorithm to downsample picture thanks to [FFmpeg's swscale library][2] for best results.
- Select one or more folders to scan from any storage (internal, SDCard...). For example DCIM, Pictures...
- Exclude one subdirectory from selected directories
- Preserve timestamps of the pictures
- Processing log
- Synchronize deleted files in the source directory to the backup and working directory (so that you don't keep in the backup folder pictures you don't have anymore in the source folder)
- Conservative default options (backup pictures, skip corrupt files)
- Install app on internal storage or external storage
- Default EXIF library: [exiv2][3].
- Alternative libraries: Android-Exif-Extended (built-in), libexif (built-in), pixymeta-android (needs manual compilation from sources). See known facts on project page to learn more on benefits and drawbacks of each library.
- Settings: 
&emsp;- Rotate the thumbnail
&emsp;- Replace existing thumbnail
&emsp;- Backup of original pictures (backup is never overwritten by the app once created if you choose to add the thumbnail to the input file in it initial location)
&emsp;- Skip pictures having malformed metadata (this can be disabled to process also files having corrupt tags)
&emsp;- Replace picture inplace or write new picture to another directory

<b>Requested permissions</b>

- <i>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</i> and <i>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</i>
&emsp;- to keep the timestamp of the pictures
- <i>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</i>
&emsp;- requested only with the <i>standard</i> flavor that is shipped on F-Droid for devices running Android 11 and above to keep the timestamp of the pictures
